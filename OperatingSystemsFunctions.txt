One operating system funstion is managing programs. 
There are two ways an operating system can manage programs, the first is a single tasking operating system and the second is a multitasking operating system.
A sisngle task operating system cannot run more than one program at a time, so if you wanted to switch between a couple task such as watching a show and checking email you would have to close one to do the other.
With multitasking operating systems you can run multiple programs at once and dont have to exit one before starting up a new one.
